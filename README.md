# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MP
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  - Vehicle Length
  - Ground Clearance
  - Intercept
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  - No because the p-value is 5.35e-11 which is less than 0.05. Meaning there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis and that the slope is not zero.
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  - Yes because the R-squared is 0.7149. 71.5% of the variablilty of MPG is explained using this linear model.
